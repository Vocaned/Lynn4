# my discord bot i guess

### History
Originally I made Lynn around 2017 with Discord.JS. I was mainly a C# developer back then, but wanted to try something different so I chose JavaScript.

Only a year later in 2018, I made Lynn2, an another Discord.JS bot. This only lasted a couple of months until I gave up with JavaScript and moved to C#.

Mid-2018 I started experimenting with a C# bot, Lynn2.5. It was identical to Lynn2 but in a different language. At this time I was moving to developing with Python, but I wasn't confident enough to make a bot with it yet.

Then comes 2019, and at this point I was pretty much exclusively coding in Python, so I wrote a new version of Lynn, Lynn3. This was my biggest bot, with over 50 commands. You can find that bot [here](https://github.com/Fam0r/lynn3).

I wasn't planning on making rewriting the bot a semi-yearly thing, but in 2021 Discord released a bot API update that allows better integration with the client, and I started to get disgusted by the spaghetti code that Lynn3 grew into, so I figured that I might as well start from scratch again, with Lynn4.

Later in 2021, [discord.py was discontinued](https://gist.github.com/Rapptz/4a2f62751b9600a31a0d3c78100287f1). As a replacement I decided to try [hikari](https://github.com/hikari-py/hikari) instead.
